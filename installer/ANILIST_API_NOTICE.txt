AiringDeck AniList API Notice
=============================

AiringDeck is an unofficial desktop client that connects to AniList through
the official OAuth + GraphQL APIs.

What AiringDeck does:
- asks you to sign in with your own AniList account (OAuth),
- reads your anime list and airing-related metadata needed for this app,
- stores auth tokens using the OS secure storage (keyring),
- supports conservative request pacing and timeout handling.

What AiringDeck does not do by default:
- it does not collect your AniList password,
- it does not run an AiringDeck cloud tracker backend,
- it does not enable hidden telemetry by default,
- it does not keep long-term AniList payload cache by default.

AniList is a third-party service and can change its API/ToS over time.
By using AiringDeck with AniList, you acknowledge that AniList terms apply.
